# Outline Design Reference

## Sub-agent Strategy

Decompose outline design into parallel specialist tasks, then synthesize:

| Agent | Mission | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| requirement_analyst | Extract all explicit and implicit requirements from user query + uploaded files | Structured requirements doc |
| structure_designer | Design chapter hierarchy, weight distribution, word count allocation | Skeleton with numbering and word targets |
| artifact_analyst | Read and synthesize research artifacts from `{workspace}/research/` (`{topic}_insight.md`, `{topic}_cross_verification.md`, key `{topic}_dim{NN}.md` files) to identify themes, data points, and source structure | Research synthesis with citations |
| content_planner | For each chapter, define specific content points, required elements (tables, cases), and presentation approach | Detailed chapter specs |

Run requirement_analyst and artifact_analyst in parallel first. Feed their outputs to structure_designer and content_planner. Finally, the Orchestrator synthesizes all outputs into the unified outline.

**User-provided files**: If the user supplied files or paths (data, prior drafts, reference materials), include a file_analyst agent to extract useful information from those paths. If none were provided, skip.

## Sub-agent Output Rules

Sub-agents output only their analysis content. They must NOT include:
- Summary tables, overview charts, or "chapter structure recap"
- Logic relationship diagrams or ASCII art
- Team assignment suggestions or division of labor
- Emoji, decorative separators, or "design highlights"

The Orchestrator filters these out during synthesis even if they leak through.

## 4-Level Heading Format

This is non-negotiable. The outline is the contract that writers execute against.

```
# Title (H1, no number — only for main title and "References" section)

## 1. Chapter Title (H2 — numbered, maps to a chapter file)
### 1.1 Section Title (H3 — numbered subsection)
#### 1.1.1 Point Summary (H4 — the atomic content unit, a concise actionable statement)

## 2. Another Chapter
### 2.1 Section
#### 2.1.1 Point
#### 2.1.2 Point

# References
## File Name
- **Type**: file type
- **Description**: purpose
- **Path**: {workspace}/...
```

**Why this structure matters**: Writers receive their chapter's outline excerpt and execute it literally. H4 headings are their task list — each one becomes a paragraph or content block. If H4s are vague ("discuss trends"), writers produce vague content. If H4s are specific ("Global EV battery costs dropped 14% YoY in 2024, driven by LFP adoption in China"), writers produce substantive content.

### Rules

- **H5 is forbidden.** Never use `#####` or 4-digit numbering (1.1.1.1). If logic needs more depth, flatten: promote sub-points to siblings (1.1.2, 1.1.3) or merge into the parent H4's description
- **H1**: main title + "References" section only. No numbering
- **H2**: chapters. Numbered: `## 1. Title`
- **H3**: sections within chapters. Numbered: `### 1.1 Title`
- **H4**: content points. Numbered: `#### 1.1.1 Title`. Concise but specific enough to be executable
- **Abstracts/Executive Summaries**: only for formal research reports. Placed before `## 1.` with no numbering. Most reports don't need them
- All H2/H3/H4 must have sequential numbering. H1 never has numbering

### Quantification

Every chapter-level (H2) entry should specify:
- Target word count
- Required elements (number of tables, case studies, data points)
- Key sources or data to incorporate

This turns the outline from a "table of contents" into an "execution spec."

## Citations in Outlines

Even at the outline stage, specific facts and data points need citations:

- Use standard Markdown footnotes: `[^id]` in the outline text, with the
  `[^id]: Title. Date. URL` definition placed at the end of the outline
- Reuse the same `[^id]` for the same source (same URL); ids may differ across
  sub-agents — the assembly step merges by URL, so no manual coordination needed

**Source priority**: T1 (government, international orgs, top journals, official filings) > T2 (Reuters, Bloomberg, major think tanks) > Reject (content farms, anonymous forums, unverified social media)

## Validation Checklist

Before saving the outline, verify:

- [ ] Every user requirement has a corresponding section
- [ ] 4-level hierarchy only — no H5, no 4-digit numbering
- [ ] All H2/H3/H4 are numbered; H1 is not
- [ ] H4 titles are specific and executable, not vague
- [ ] Word counts and required elements specified per chapter
- [ ] "References" section lists all intermediate files (outline, uploaded files)
- [ ] No extraneous content: no summary tables, no structure overviews, no emoji
- [ ] Citations use standard footnote `[^id]` format where specific data appears, each with an inline definition
