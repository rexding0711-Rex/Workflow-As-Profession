# Outline Design Reference (Academic Papers)

## Sub-agent Strategy

| Agent | Mission | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| requirement_analyst | Extract research questions, scope, constraints, target venue from user query + files | Requirements doc |
| artifact_analyst | Synthesize research artifacts from `{workspace}/research/` to identify prior work, research gaps, and positioning opportunities | Literature landscape map with citations |
| structure_designer | Design section hierarchy, allocate word budgets per section | Skeleton with numbering |
| methodology_planner | Outline the research approach, data sources, analytical framework, evaluation criteria | Methodology spec |

Run requirement_analyst and artifact_analyst in parallel first. Feed their outputs to structure_designer and methodology_planner. Orchestrator synthesizes.

**User-provided files**: If the user supplied files or paths (data, prior drafts, reference papers), include a file_analyst agent to extract from those paths. If none were provided, skip.

## Standard Academic Structure

Most papers follow a canonical structure. The outline should map to this unless the user or target venue requires otherwise:

```

**This is a template, not a mandate.** Survey papers replace Methodology/Results with thematic analysis sections. Case studies have different flows. Adapt to the actual research.

## Contribution Statement

Every paper outline MUST include a clear contribution statement in the Introduction section (typically at H4 level under "1.3 Contribution Statement"). This answers three questions:
1. **What is new?** — the specific novel element (method, finding, framework, dataset)
2. **How does it differ from prior work?** — explicit contrast with closest existing work
3. **Why does it matter?** — the practical or theoretical significance

Weak: "This paper makes several contributions to the field."
Strong: "We propose X, which differs from Y[^prior-y] by addressing Z, achieving N% improvement on benchmark B."

## 4-Level Heading Format

Same rules as report-writing — non-negotiable:

- **H1**: paper title + "References" section. No numbering
- **H2**: major sections. Numbered: `## 1. Title`
- **H3**: subsections. Numbered: `### 1.1 Title`
- **H4**: content points. Numbered: `#### 1.1.1 Title` — specific, executable
- **H5 forbidden.** Flatten if logic needs more depth
- **Abstract**: before `## 1.`, no numbering
- All H2/H3/H4 sequentially numbered

### Quantification

Each H2 section should specify:
- Target word count (with percentage of total)
- Required elements (tables, figures, equations, algorithms)
- Key references to incorporate

## Citations in Outlines

- Standard Markdown footnotes: `[^id]` for specific claims, with the
  `[^id]: Author/Title. Year. URL/DOI` definition at the end of the outline
- Reuse the same `[^id]` for the same work (same URL/DOI); ids may differ across
  sub-agents — assembly merges by URL/DOI, so no manual coordination needed
- **Academic citation density is high**: artifact analyst should extract 20+ relevant works from research artifacts at the outline stage

**Source priority**: T1 (peer-reviewed journals, top conferences, official datasets) > T2 (preprints with significant citations, established technical blogs, reputable surveys) > Reject (unreviewed preprints with no citations, content farms, anonymous sources)

## Validation Checklist
